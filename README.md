**Write, Plan, Apply**


Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

**Deliver Infrastructure as Code**

**Write**
Write infrastructure as code using declarative configuration files. HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) allows for concise descriptions of resources using blocks, arguments, and expressions.

**Plan**
Run terraform plan to check whether the execution plan for a configuration matches your expectations before provisioning or changing infrastructure.

**Apply**
Apply changes to hundreds of cloud providers with terraform apply to reach the desired state of the configuration.

**How Terraform Works**
Terraform allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple, human readable language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). It reads configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be reviewed for safety and then applied and provisioned.

Extensible providers allow Terraform to manage a broad range of resources, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and hardware services.
